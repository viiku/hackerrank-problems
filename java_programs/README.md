1. File name will be equal to class name.
2. A file can only have one public class.
3. if method is static then it can be called directly not using any objects.
```
public class Employee {
    public static void main(String []args) {
        
    }
}

Main can be called using simply invoking main method.
Here, Main  method will called from JVM first,since this is a starting point. JVM doesn't require to create object to call Main method.
```

### why a java file can have a only one public class?
